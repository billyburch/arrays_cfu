How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*I feel pretty confident with the content and logic behind Arrays, but when using VS Code instead of irb, I was a little uncertain how to manipulate my arrays most efficiently and see the results of the methods I employed.*
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*I would like to find a video of someone using arrays in VS Code so I can better understand how to more efficiently see my changes than running the file each time.*
What questions do you have about Arrays?
*I decided to run with the print command instead of puts because I felt the output was easier to read. I tried it both ways and wonder if there is professional etiquette around puts vs. print for arrays.*
Commit your work.
*OK!*
